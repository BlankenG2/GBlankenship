Procedures 
(unnamed)	creates context token name

		the default is <patient.id.mrn.nationalidnumber>
		
		this is the appropriate Home Telehealth value for a production system
		the expectation is that CPRS will be started first in a test environment
		the script will detect this change and respond appropriately
		
		Home Telehealth expects to use the ICN as the context token
		Home Telehealth is not able to process patients without an ICN
				
(onLoad)	invoked when the page is loaded
		reads the vault looking for an ICN token (either test or production)
		(needs to set the vault to a "null" ICN and when a patient is evenually selected)
		will change the token name if a token exists to reflect test/production
		needs to be modified if "survey" mode is not required

(Pending(contextItems) invoked when the context change is requested
		(need to clear current patient - save data, or complain using SetSurveyResponse)
		looks for ICN token
		if ICN token is present, the new new value is saved (for commit)

(Committed)	invoked when the context change is to be placed into effect
		brings the patient that was offered in the "pending" into display
		if the "offered" and "committed" patient is not available/allowed, the display remains blank
		needs to be modified if "survey" mode is not required
		
(Cancelled)	invoked	when context change is cancelled
		(a surveyed system said, "no")
		the display remains blank
		
(btn_click)	invoked when patient context is to be switched by application
		the code places only one token in the vault (ICN)
		the transition is started and then committed 
		if all parties accept the new patient should be displayed
		otherwise the context should be cancelled.
